        <h3>Volunteer 1: The <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a> with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thrive_saiv?igsh=OGJlYTh4NmU1aW02">Thrive</a></h3>
        <p>Engaging in the Big Event with Thrive was more than just a day of service; it was a transformative experience that strengthened our bonds with the local community. My group and I rolled up our sleeves to tackle a neighborhood revitalization project, assisting a family with their front and back yard cleanup. The joy on the faces of the family and the visible transformation of their living space created a sense of accomplishment and unity. This experience underscored the profound impact that collective action can have on fostering a sense of belonging and support within our community.</p>

        <h3>Volunteer 2: Enriching Lives at the <a href="https://www.civitasseniorliving.com/the-avenues-of-fort-bend/">Old Age Home</a></h3>
        <p>Volunteering at the old age home was a heartwarming journey filled with laughter, shared stories, and meaningful connections. Engaging with the elderly residents through activities like bingo and memory games not only brought joy to their days but also created an atmosphere of camaraderie. It was an enriching experience to witness the resilience and wisdom of the elderly, fostering an intergenerational exchange of knowledge and understanding. The time spent at the old age home became a testament to the power of compassion, emphasizing the significance of human connection across generations.</p>

        <h3>Volunteer 3: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stmarysmgocsm?igsh=aGdzcXJ3Mjh2Z2o0">MGOCSM</a> Church Youth Group</h3>
        <p>Being an active member of the MGOCSM church youth group allowed me to contribute to the broader community in downtown Houston. Our collective efforts went beyond packing food; they aimed to address the immediate needs of the homeless population. Engaging with individuals experiencing homelessness provided valuable insights into their lives, struggles, and aspirations. The experience of delivering food became a platform for genuine connections, fostering a sense of empathy and understanding. It reinforced the idea that small acts of kindness, such as providing a meal, can contribute to building a more compassionate and inclusive society.</p>
