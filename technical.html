    <h3>TAMU IEEE Micro Mouse Design Team - Jan. 2022 - May 2022</h3>
    <p>As a key contributor to the TAMU IEEE Micro Mouse Design Team, I played a pivotal role in the development of an innovative Arduino-based micro mouse. The project involved:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Coding the Brain:</strong> Utilized C++ to develop the control logic for the Arduino computer that governed the robot's movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Modified the code to handle diverse obstacles, including different wall patterns. Implemented features for speed control, reversing, and precise braking.</li>
      <li><strong>Hardware Integration:</strong> Collaborated in the integration of various hardware components, including breadboards, sound and light sensors, motion sensors, motors, and integrated circuits.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Employed problem-solving skills to optimize the mouse's navigation, ensuring efficient and accurate movement in response to environmental cues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project not only honed my programming skills but also provided hands-on experience in hardware-software integration and problem-solving within a team environment.</p>

    <h3>Sudoku Solver - Feb. 2023</h3>
    <p>The Sudoku Solver project, completed in February 2023, showcases my proficiency in automated puzzle-solving using SMT-LIB code. The project highlights include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>SMT-LIB Implementation:</strong> Crafted SMT-LIB code to represent 9x9 sudoku puzzles as 700+ propositional statements, ensuring a precise and systematic approach to puzzle representation.</li>
      <li><strong>Code Verification:</strong> Rigorously tested and validated the implementation using online Z3 playgrounds and automation tools, ensuring both precision and efficiency of the solution.</li>
      <li><strong>Algorithmic Thinking:</strong> Employed algorithmic thinking to automate the solution process, contributing to the development of an efficient and accurate Sudoku Solver.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Validated the solver's accuracy against known sudoku solutions, ensuring reliability and correctness in puzzle resolution.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project not only showcased my technical skills in automated problem-solving but also demonstrated my commitment to precision and efficiency in algorithmic implementations.</p>

            <h3>Ongoing Project: BMI Calculator App</h3>
            <p>Currently working on a BMI Calculator App that aims to provide users with an easy and intuitive way to track and monitor their body mass index. The app will include the following features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Input for user weight and height.</li>
              <li>Calculation of BMI based on the entered data.</li>
              <li>Interpretation and display of BMI categories (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight).</li>
              <li>Graphical representation of BMI trends over time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The app is being developed using technologies such as React Native for cross-platform compatibility and Firebase for data storage. This project is driven by the goal of promoting health awareness and encouraging users to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Stay tuned for updates and a demo soon!</p>
